/**
 * Product container that can be used as shopping cart and inventory, which both
 * contain (product, quantity) tuples. This Container uses a List of
 * ProductQuantity objects to store its content. To be able to support the
 * concept of owner, customer or session, the ProductContainer has an owner
 * field, which is copied into the ProductQuantity owner field.
 * <br/>
 * Invariant: The product quantities in this container and its partner
 * (Inventory and Cart as example) stay in balance. As long as no sale has taken
 * place, the products are contained in either container and the overall sum of
 * products over all products is constant.<br>
 *
 * The container supports transfer of products to a partner container and adding
 * and removing of products to this container. Adding is done when the container
 * is filled without partner (thick of re-stocking the inventory), removing when
 * the contents of the container is sold to a customer (typically the cart).<br>
 *
 * Although the transfer of ProductQuantities from a source to a target
 * container can be thought of as the compound operation "take from source and
 * merge to target", it would not be transactional. To be able to make this
 * transfer transactional, the method <code>transferTo(ProductContainer target,
 * ProductQuantity pq)</code> should be used.
