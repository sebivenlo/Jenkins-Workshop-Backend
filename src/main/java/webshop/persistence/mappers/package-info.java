/**
 *
 * This mapper package is a layer between the business and the persistence.
 *
 * A mapper "maps" entities from one world to or from the java world. The
 * typical example is mapping database records to java object.
 * <br/>
 * In a in memory implementation probably no mapping is required, so that an
 * ordinary container (list, set or map) can fulfil a combined role. This sounds
 * a lot like shared responsibilities, but then, that is what it is.
